<p><b>
For the past 9 years I have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer. <br/> It gave me a lot of practical knowledge,<br/> useful tools and also judgmental and analytical thinking. <br/>
 <br/>But then I decided to change the course <br/> and begin a brand new journey in my life. <p/> 
Although some of the skills required in my work as a lawyer  <br/> are tangential to the work of the QA engineer,<br/> such as precision without compromise or 
the ability to spot all the small details <br/> as well as seeing the bigger picture in order to prevent mistakes from happening,<br/> it is still a brand new field for me <br/> and I'm excited to see what the future holds!
