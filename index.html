	<h2>LORA ROSENSTEIN</h2>
Hi everyone and welcome to my website! <span style='font-size:50px;'>&#128525;</span>
	<h3><u><i>A little bit about myself</u></h3></i>
	
My name is Lora and I'm 37 years old.<br/> I live in Modiin with my husband and our 4 year old amazing beautiful girl.
<p>
For the past 9 years I have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer. <br/> It gave me a lot of practical knowledge, useful tools and also judgmental and analytical thinking. <br/>
 <br/>But then I decided to change the course and do something entirely different. <p/> 
Although some of the skills required in my work as a lawyer  <br/> are tangential to the work of the QA engineer,<br/> such as precision without compromise or 
the ability to spot all the small details <br/> as well as seeing the bigger picture in order to prevent mistakes from happening,<br/> it is stil a brand new field and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me!
